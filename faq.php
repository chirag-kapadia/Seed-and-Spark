										      	<p>Seed And Spark is a funding platform for creative projects. Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Seed And Spark is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative ideas that are brought to life through the direct support of others.

												Everything on Seed And Spark must be a project with a clear goal, like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it.</p>

										      	<p>Seed And Spark aims to give each one of us a chance to fund our ideas, starting directly with the people who are closest to it (friends, fans, community-fellows). And it’s a way to break beyond the traditional methods — loans, investment, industry deals, grants — to discover that we can offer each other value through creation without a middleman dictating the product and terms.</p>

										      	<p>	A project is a finite work with a clear goal that you’d like to bring to life. Think albums, books, or films. 
												The funding goal is the amount of money that a creator needs to complete their project. 

												Funding on Seed And Spark is all-or-nothing. No one will be charged for a pledge towards a project unless it reaches its funding goal. This way, creators always have the budget they scoped out before moving forward. 

												A creator is the person or team behind the project idea, working to bring it to life. 

												Backers are folks who pledge money to join creators in bringing projects to life. 

												Rewards are a creator's chance to share a piece of their project with their backer community. Typically, these are one-of-a-kind experiences, limited editions, or copies of the creative work being produced. </p>

										    <div class="panel-body">
										      	<p>All-or-nothing funding is a core part of Seed And Spark and has a number of advantages: 
												It's less risk for everyone. If a project doesn’t reach its funding goal, creators will not be expected to complete their project without the funds necessary to do so, and backers will not be charged. 

												It motivates. Adding a sense of urgency motivates your community to spread the word and rally behind your project. 

												It works. Of the projects that have reached 60% of their funding goal, 98% were successfully funded. We find that projects either realize and surpass their goal, or they never fully take off.</p>

									    <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
										    <div class="panel-body">
										      	<p>	When a project is overfunded backers sometimes wonder: what happens with all that “extra” money? If a creator has a funding goal of Rs 5,000 and raises Rs 25,000, what do they do with the  Rs20,000 they didn’t ask for?

												Most of the time what seems like “extra” money isn’t extra at all. Ten times the funding often means ten times the investors. 

												Sometimes when a project is overfunded, it lets the creator put that money back into the project to create something better for the backers and themselves.

												In other cases, overfunding leads to better margins and the creator may even profit from the project. This often means that the creator can continue the project beyond Seed And Spark — and backers are part of that story. In this series, a few creators share details on what changed when their projects were overfunded.</p>
